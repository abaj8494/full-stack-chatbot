# howdy

this repository is for learning. I found myself unable to explain `middleware` and the high-level architecting required
to build a **chatbot** during an interview. 

as such I purchased [a book](https://abaj.ai/words/library/books/fullstack-typescript/) which is authored by a senior
typscript engineer and details how to build such an app with:
- Bun
- Hono
- Zod
- SQL
- OpenAI API

it also details modern software engineering:
- testing, logging, debugging
- encapsulation, oop, typing
- middleware, rest

# timeline

i anticipate to complete the book in 3 weeks.
